 - Updated prefix database: Added AEPP, FFPS, FNaF1..FNaF4, GDL, GM, LTR.
 - Support of command "@? !MID" in BMG text files.
 - wkmpt DIFF: The 16-bit value at offset 6 in all KMP section headers is now
   also compared.
 - The output of wszst distribution and wlect distrib distrib= have been
   rearranged so that the most important information about the distribution
   is now at the beginning of the file. @REFERENCE-NAME has been removed.
 - wstrt --add-lecode: A new LE-CODE starter has been implemented to avoid
   multiple linking when using additional REL files.
 - New option: wstrt --add-old-lecode: Add the old LE-CODE starter.

~ - KMP:STGI support for up to 255 laps.
~    - Option --kmp=MODES supports now settings 1LAP .. 15LAPS.
~    - New option --n-laps=LAPS override --kmp=MODES and accept 1 to 255 laps.
~
~ - MDL support: Scanning a MDL file and transferring the data into an internal
~   format was already implemented, but only used for analysis purposes. Now it
~   is possible to create a binary MDL by reading the internal data. This is
~   the first step to add MDL materials to enable a track for slot 4.2.
~ - The tools verify the maximum number of CKPT, ENPT and ITPT (=255).

Known bugs:

 - Minimaps with an additional bones layer above 'posLD' and 'posRU' (e.g. for
   scaling) are handled incorrect on auto adjusting the minimap.
 - The tools try always to find the optimal PNG format by analyzing the main
   image. The bug is, that mipmaps (or following images in TPL) may need a
   different output format (for example colors instead of grayscale).
   SOLUTION: Force an output format with for example --transform RGBA32.
~ - Creating a BRRES from local files is buggy, because missing adjust of
~   several BRRES and string pool pointers.
~ - If creating a BRRES the internal name of the sub file is not set to
~   the filename. This could be problematic if a sub file was renamed.
