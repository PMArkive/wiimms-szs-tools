 - There is a new property for parsing the command line. In a preliminary
   step, the options "-@FILENAME" (1 argument) and "-@ FILENAME" (2 arguments)
   are searched. Each occurrence is replaced by the contents of file FILENAME,
   which again may contain "-@...". The maximum recursion depth is 10.
   Wildcard patterns are not resolved.
 - New command for all tools: EXPAND: All parameters are treated as a filename
   with wildcards and all matching files are searched.
 - New command: wszst SPLIT: Analyse (file) names and split them into the
   different parts. Print the results in machine readable format.
 - Command wlect CREATE re-implemented. Type 'wlect create help' for details.
 - New command: wlect DISTRIBUTION: The command manages data for LE-CODE track
   distributions. It reads any number of source files with different file
   types, collects the data and creates any number of files with different
   file types. Type 'wlect distribution' without arguments to get details.
 - New file formats to support wlect DISTRIBUTION: LE-DEF, LE-DIS, LE-REF,
   LE-STR, SHA1REF and PREFIX.

~ - MDL support: Scanning a MDL file and transferring the data into an internal
~   format was already implemented, but only used for analysis purposes. Now it
~   is possible to create a binary MDL by reading the internal data. This is
~   the first step to add MDL materials to enable a track for slot 4.2.
~ - The tools verify the maximum number of CKPT, ENPT and ITPT (=255).

Known bugs:

 - Minimaps with an additional bones layer above 'posLD' and 'posRU' (e.g. for
   scaling) are handled incorrect on auto adjusting the minimap.
 - The tools try always to find the optimal PNG format by analyzing the main
   image. The bug is, that mipmaps (or following images in TPL) may need a
   different output format (for example colors instead of grayscale).
   SOLUTION: Force an output format with for example --transform RGBA32.
~ - Creating a BRRES from local files is buggy, because missing adjust of
~   several BRRES and string pool pointers.
~ - If creating a BRRES the internal name of the sub file is not set to
~   the filename. This could be problematic if a sub file was renamed.
