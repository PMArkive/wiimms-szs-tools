 - Updated integrated LE-CODE binaries to v5 build 36.
 - LPAR: Official support of new features BT-WORLDWIDE and VS-WORLDWIDE. This
   was already implemented hidden in version v2.29a.
 - File format LE-DEF: Instructions STANDARD-BATTLE-ARENAS and/or
   STANDARD-VERSUS-TRACKS will be executed automatically if no other battle
   arena or no other versus track are defined.
 - wlect DISTRIB: 
    - Bug fix: Random slots are ignored now if adding missed tracks to cups.
    - Fixed import of LE-CODE binaries without standard tracks.
    - New instructions: CUP-ICONS, CUP-INFO (both are experimental).
    - New processing option OUT-DUMMY to accept/ignore generic dummy names.
 - Tool wimgt supports generic images. The main application is the creation of
   cup-icons, as used e.g. by MKW-Fun. At the moment only an incomplete
   documentation is available at https://szs.wiimm.de/doc/genericimg .

~ - MDL support: Scanning a MDL file and transferring the data into an internal
~   format was already implemented, but only used for analysis purposes. Now it
~   is possible to create a binary MDL by reading the internal data. This is
~   the first step to add MDL materials to enable a track for slot 4.2.
~ - The tools verify the maximum number of CKPT, ENPT and ITPT (=255).

Known bugs:

 - Minimaps with an additional bones layer above 'posLD' and 'posRU' (e.g. for
   scaling) are handled incorrect on auto adjusting the minimap.
 - The tools try always to find the optimal PNG format by analyzing the main
   image. The bug is, that mipmaps (or following images in TPL) may need a
   different output format (for example colors instead of grayscale).
   SOLUTION: Force an output format with for example --transform RGBA32.
~ - Creating a BRRES from local files is buggy, because missing adjust of
~   several BRRES and string pool pointers.
~ - If creating a BRRES the internal name of the sub file is not set to
~   the filename. This could be problematic if a sub file was renamed.
