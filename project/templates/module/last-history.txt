 - Command "wlect DUMP":
    - Accept option --brief to print file header of LE-CODE binaries only.
    - New command "wlect DB" is a short cut for "wlect DUMP --brief".
    - New command "wlect DLLL" is a short cut for "wlect DUMP -lll".
    - Fixed some issues if displaying LE-CODE v5 dates.
    - Dump of LE-CODE binaries improved.
 - Command "wlect DISTRIB":
    - Fixed support for random slots in cups.
    - Updated distribution generator "distrib=...".
    - New processing option: +CUT-ALL.
 - File format #LE-DEF:
    - Section [TRACK-LIST]: New instruction IGNORE-SLOT to ignore SLOT
      instructions. When exporting, SLOT instructions are now inserted so that
      an identical track distribution is achieved when reading in.
    - Section [CUP-LIST]: New instructions APPEND-BT and APPEND-VS to force
      the cup type (battle or versus). This is important for random tracks.

~ - MDL support: Scanning a MDL file and transferring the data into an internal
~   format was already implemented, but only used for analysis purposes. Now it
~   is possible to create a binary MDL by reading the internal data. This is
~   the first step to add MDL materials to enable a track for slot 4.2.
~ - The tools verify the maximum number of CKPT, ENPT and ITPT (=255).

Known bugs:

 - Minimaps with an additional bones layer above 'posLD' and 'posRU' (e.g. for
   scaling) are handled incorrect on auto adjusting the minimap.
 - The tools try always to find the optimal PNG format by analyzing the main
   image. The bug is, that mipmaps (or following images in TPL) may need a
   different output format (for example colors instead of grayscale).
   SOLUTION: Force an output format with for example --transform RGBA32.
~ - Creating a BRRES from local files is buggy, because missing adjust of
~   several BRRES and string pool pointers.
~ - If creating a BRRES the internal name of the sub file is not set to
~   the filename. This could be problematic if a sub file was renamed.
