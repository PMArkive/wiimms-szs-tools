 - Option --max-file-size=SIZE now accepts sizes up to 2 GiB. For LTA files
   it is automatically set to 2 GiB.
 - New file format: LTA = LE-CODE Track Archive.
   Sometime in the future such archives will replace the individual track
   files to save space (smaller file list) in LE-CODE distributions. In
   addition, common files are to be managed so that the extraction of these
   files by the distribution creator is no longer necessary.
 - New file format: LFL = LE-CODE File List
   The file format was developed to store the common files in LTA files in
   a way that LE-CODE can use easily.
 - wlect distrib:
    - New string type 'PATH', which manages paths to the track files.
    - New instructions LTA=DIRECTORY and LTA-RM=DIRECTORY, which will create
      LE-CODE Track Archives.
 - wszst XCOMMON: If at least 1 file is extracted, then file "avail.txt" is
   created. This helps LE-CODE to detect extracted common files, because we
   don't know how to detect directories by LE-CODE.
 - New LPAR setting: USE-AVAIL-TXT.

~ - KMP:STGI support for up to 255 laps.
~    - Option --kmp=MODES supports now settings 1LAP .. 15LAPS.
~    - New option --n-laps=LAPS override --kmp=MODES and accept 1 to 255 laps.
~
~ - MDL support: Scanning a MDL file and transferring the data into an internal
~   format was already implemented, but only used for analysis purposes. Now it
~   is possible to create a binary MDL by reading the internal data. This is
~   the first step to add MDL materials to enable a track for slot 4.2.
~ - The tools verify the maximum number of CKPT, ENPT and ITPT (=255).

Known bugs:

 - Minimaps with an additional bones layer above 'posLD' and 'posRU' (e.g. for
   scaling) are handled incorrect on auto adjusting the minimap.
 - The tools try always to find the optimal PNG format by analyzing the main
   image. The bug is, that mipmaps (or following images in TPL) may need a
   different output format (for example colors instead of grayscale).
   SOLUTION: Force an output format with for example --transform RGBA32.
~ - Creating a BRRES from local files is buggy, because missing adjust of
~   several BRRES and string pool pointers.
~ - If creating a BRRES the internal name of the sub file is not set to
~   the filename. This could be problematic if a sub file was renamed.
