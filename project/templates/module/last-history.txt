szs v@@VERSION@@ r@@REV-NEXT@@ - @@@@-@@-@@

 - New parameter for LEX section SET1: START-ITEM: Declare that a player can
   get an item through an item box before race start.
 - wszst ANALYSE: LEX:SET1:START-ITEM is recognized and evaluated.
 - wstrt PORT+WHERE: Use new option --upper (-U) to force upper case digits in
   hex numbers.
 - wstrt PORT: Ported cheat codes are always printed with upper case digits
   and without 0x prefix.
 - wstrt PORT: Porting database updated. Many false records removed by
   updated generator script.
 - Fewer program crashes when reading faulty SZS files.
 - New section [SETUP-ARENA] for LE-CODE definition files: Define music and
   property slots for battle arenas.
 - New global option: --warn=LIST (short -W LIST): Enable or disable warnings.
 - New command: wkclt SHA1: Print a SHA1 checksum of the KCL for each source.
   The checksum is calculated after patching.
 - New command: wkclt TYPES: Scan KCL types from command line in different
   variants and print the result as flag, type, value and groups W, X, Y & Z.
 - New command: wszst IS-TEXTURE: Test tracks to see if it's a texture hack.
 - wszst ANALYZE: Detect goombas with scale other than 1.00.

~ - MDL support: Scanning a MDL file and transferring the data into an internal
~   format was already implemented, but only used for analysis purposes. Now it
~   is possible to create a binary MDL by reading the internal data. This is
~   the first step to add MDL materials to enable a track for slot 4.2.
~ - The tools verify the maximum number of CKPT, ENPT and ITPT (=255).

Known bugs:

 - Minimaps with an additional bones layer above 'posLD' and 'posRU' (e.g. for
   scaling) are handled incorrect on auto adjusting the minimap.
 - The tools try always to find the optimal PNG format by analyzing the main
   image. The bug is, that mipmaps (or following images in TPL) may need a
   different output format (for example colors instead of grayscale).
   SOLUTION: Force an output format with for example --transform RGBA32.
~ - Creating a BRRES from local files is buggy, because missing adjust of
~   several BRRES and string pool pointers.
~ - If creating a BRRES the internal name of the sub file is not set to
~   the filename. This could be problematic if a sub file was renamed.
