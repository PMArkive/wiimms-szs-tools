 - Update to LE-CODE build 40.
 - Updated prefix database: Added LEGO_Racers, Muppet_RM, POD, PP2WB, SR,
   Spyro_1, Wii_U, Zelda_OoT, Zelda_TP, Zelda_WW.
 - wszst ANALYSE prints attribute "license" if file "license.txt" is detected.
 - File format LTA supports now an optional list with file extensions. The
   idea is that tools show the correct file extensions without having to load
   the entire LTA file for analysis.
 - Command wlect DISTRIB:
    - WU8, WBZ and WLZ files are accepted now.
    - Support of new file type USE-LTA (redirection file for LE-CODE).
      Instruction lta= of command wlect DISTRIB creates such a file with
      filename lta.szs if option REDIR is set.
    - The new processing options +PR0, +PR1 to +PR60 control the output of
      progress messages.
    - New options for instruction lta=: EXT, REDIR, PR0, PR1 .. PR60.
 - Command wszst WILDCARDS supports options --sh and --bash to quote results.
 - Command wstrt PATCH and option --add-section:
    - GCT text files are now accepted now and converted to binary data if the
      very first 4 characters are "#GCT".
    - The memory map output with options -vv has been completely revised.
 - Bug fix for commands wszst NORMALIZE and wszst PATCH: If the content has
   not been changed, then the compression has not been checked. Therefore the
   file was not always normalized.
 - Bug fix for wszst PATCH: A copy to the non existing cache was created even
   if --cache was not set.
 - Implemented support for LE-CODE with 8192 tracks and 2048 cups. For this
   purpose, the BMG messages for mkw-ana had to be moved to other areas.
 - wlect dump: Warnings are issued if the tool can manage fewer LPAR settings
   or fewer track slots than the LE-CODE image offers.
 - New global option --le-04x: Use format %04x instead of %03x for LE-CODE
   slots to enable uniform slot numbers if slots >4095 are used.
 - New LPAR setting: SLOT-04X.

~ - KMP:STGI support for up to 255 laps.
~    - Option --kmp=MODES supports now settings 1LAP .. 15LAPS.
~    - New option --n-laps=LAPS override --kmp=MODES and accept 1 to 255 laps.
~
~ - MDL support: Scanning a MDL file and transferring the data into an internal
~   format was already implemented, but only used for analysis purposes. Now it
~   is possible to create a binary MDL by reading the internal data. This is
~   the first step to add MDL materials to enable a track for slot 4.2.
~ - The tools verify the maximum number of CKPT, ENPT and ITPT (=255).

Known bugs:

 - Minimaps with an additional bones layer above 'posLD' and 'posRU' (e.g. for
   scaling) are handled incorrect on auto adjusting the minimap.
 - The tools try always to find the optimal PNG format by analyzing the main
   image. The bug is, that mipmaps (or following images in TPL) may need a
   different output format (for example colors instead of grayscale).
   SOLUTION: Force an output format with for example --transform RGBA32.
~ - Creating a BRRES from local files is buggy, because missing adjust of
~   several BRRES and string pool pointers.
~ - If creating a BRRES the internal name of the sub file is not set to
~   the filename. This could be problematic if a sub file was renamed.
