szs v@@VERSION@@ r@@REV-NEXT@@ - @@@@-@@-@@

 - Fixed a bug that probably exists since v2.29a: Using option --auto-add with
   SZS files with unusal or empty sub-files could cause a crash in certain
   circumstances.
 - Updated prefix database (added MP7).
 - Optimized spacing of fonts for cup icons.
 - wszst LIST including all short cuts like 'wszst LLL':
    - Wildcards are accepted as source. See https://szs.wiimm.de/doc/wildcards
      for details. After evaluating the wildcards, all input files are sorted
      according to their path and duplicates are deleted.
    - Option --in-order: Display the input files in order of the command line
      and don't delete duplicates.
    - Tuned table output.
 - wszst PATCH:
    - Wildcards are accepted as source. See https://szs.wiimm.de/doc/wildcards
      for details.
    - New option --no-copy: Don't copy a file if it was not modified.
    - New option --le-menu: Patch SZS files from directory .../Scene/UI/ to
      change the menu as required by LE-CODE to be able to select tracks from
      more than 8 cups.
    - New option --title-screen=dir: Specify a directory from which to search
      and replace title screens. Title screens only appear in the file
      'Title.szs' and there in the sub-directory './title/timg/'.
    - New option --cup-icons=file: Load given image, convert it to TPL.CMPR
      and add the result as sub-files 'button/timg/ct_icons.tpl' and as
      'control/timg/ct_icons.tpl' to files 'Channel.szs', 'MenuMulti.szs' and
      'MenuSingle.szs'.
 - wlect DISTRIB:
    - If a filename beginns with a plus sign, the plus sign is removed and the
      output file is opened in append mode.
    - If an output file is opened for the second time, then it is
      automatically opened in append mode.
    - Instruction report=: Added methods of analysis: CLASSES, XCLASSES.
 - New command: wszst UI-CHECK: Classify SZS files from directory ./Scene/UI/.
   For the analysis, the filename is ignored and only the content is examined.
   Wildcards and option --in-order are supported.
 - New option: wszst --parallel: Tell the tool that it will be called multiple
   times in parallel. Currently it only has an effect if --cache is enabled.
 - New LPAR parameter: STATICR-POINTS.
 - All tools: Command V is a well defined short cut for command VERSION.

~ - MDL support: Scanning a MDL file and transferring the data into an internal
~   format was already implemented, but only used for analysis purposes. Now it
~   is possible to create a binary MDL by reading the internal data. This is
~   the first step to add MDL materials to enable a track for slot 4.2.
~ - The tools verify the maximum number of CKPT, ENPT and ITPT (=255).

Known bugs:

 - Minimaps with an additional bones layer above 'posLD' and 'posRU' (e.g. for
   scaling) are handled incorrect on auto adjusting the minimap.
 - The tools try always to find the optimal PNG format by analyzing the main
   image. The bug is, that mipmaps (or following images in TPL) may need a
   different output format (for example colors instead of grayscale).
   SOLUTION: Force an output format with for example --transform RGBA32.
~ - Creating a BRRES from local files is buggy, because missing adjust of
~   several BRRES and string pool pointers.
~ - If creating a BRRES the internal name of the sub file is not set to
~   the filename. This could be problematic if a sub file was renamed.
