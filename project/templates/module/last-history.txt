 - Bug fix: If creating a LPAR file, a parameter with name ITEM-CHEATS was
   printed. But tool wlect accepted only ITEM-CHEAT (without leading 'S').
 - Bug fix: Since previous version the tools recomended slots 3.1 + 6.2 + 7.1
   for some tracks.
 - New command: wstrt WHERE address...: The segment in which the specified
   addresses are located is calculated for each region.
 - New command: wstrt PORT ...: Port addresses from one region to all others.
 - Mac support improved. Universal binaries for x86_64 and arm64.
 - Support of LE-CODE build 29.

~ - MDL support: Scanning a MDL file and transferring the data into an internal
~   format was already implemented, but only used for analysis purposes. Now it
~   is possible to create a binary MDL by reading the internal data. This is
~   the first step to add MDL materials to enable a track for slot 4.2.
~ - The tools verify the maximum number of CKPT, ENPT and ITPT (=255).

Known bugs:

 - Minimaps with an additional bones layer above 'posLD' and 'posRU' (e.g. for
   scaling) are handled incorrect on auto adjusting the minimap.
 - The tools try always to find the optimal PNG format by analyzing the main
   image. The bug is, that mipmaps (or following images in TPL) may need a
   different output format (for example colors instead of grayscale).
   SOLUTION: Force an output format with for example --transform RGBA32.
~ - Creating a BRRES from local files is buggy, because missing adjust of
~   several BRRES and string pool pointers.
~ - If creating a BRRES the internal name of the sub file is not set to
~   the filename. This could be problematic if a sub file was renamed.
