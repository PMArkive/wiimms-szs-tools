szs v@@VERSION@@ r@@REV-NEXT@@ - @@@@-@@-@@

 - Updated prefix database: Added CTGPS, EX, EXTR, GK2, GK3, GK7, HGSS, HWTA,
   SBSPLCP, SKK, TGO. Removed LPC.
 - Bug fix for option --lex-purge: The tools occasionally crashed when
   attempting to delete an existing but unneeded LEX file.
 - Added support for compression methods YBZ and YLZ (Yaz0 header, but
   alternative compressions bzip2 or LZMA). Use one of the new options --cybz,
   --ybz, --cylz or --ylz to select the new methods. LE-CODE supports YLZ.
 - New option --zero (-z): This option affects the exit status of the
   programs. Instead of an exit status, the value 0 is returned for OK. This
   happens for notices (-v, status<15), warnings (-vv, status<29), errors
   (-vvv, status<115) and fatal errors (-vvvv). The exit status for INTERRUPT
   (112) is never replaced.
 - Information only: wszst now knows 243 different options.

~ - KMP:STGI support for up to 255 laps.
~    - Option --kmp=MODES supports now settings 1LAP .. 15LAPS.
~    - New option --n-laps=LAPS override --kmp=MODES and accept 1 to 255 laps.
~
~ - MDL support: Scanning a MDL file and transferring the data into an internal
~   format was already implemented, but only used for analysis purposes. Now it
~   is possible to create a binary MDL by reading the internal data. This is
~   the first step to add MDL materials to enable a track for slot 4.2.
~ - The tools verify the maximum number of CKPT, ENPT and ITPT (=255).

Known bugs:

 - Minimaps with an additional bones layer above 'posLD' and 'posRU' (e.g. for
   scaling) are handled incorrect on auto adjusting the minimap.
 - The tools try always to find the optimal PNG format by analyzing the main
   image. The bug is, that mipmaps (or following images in TPL) may need a
   different output format (for example colors instead of grayscale).
   SOLUTION: Force an output format with for example --transform RGBA32.
~ - Creating a BRRES from local files is buggy, because missing adjust of
~   several BRRES and string pool pointers.
~ - If creating a BRRES the internal name of the sub file is not set to
~   the filename. This could be problematic if a sub file was renamed.
