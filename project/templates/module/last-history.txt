szs v@@VERSION@@ r@@REV-NEXT@@ - @@@@-@@-@@

 - Updated prefix, object and porting databases.
 - Updated integrated LE-CODE binaries to v4 build 34.
 - Support of LE-CODE v4.b34 and v5.b35 with 16-bits flags.
 - Added LE-CODE protection against changes by SZS tools that are too old.
 - LPAR: Support of new features BT-TEXTURES, VS-TEXTURES and BLOCK-TEXTURES.
 - Bug fix: If creating a LPAR file (by "wlect create lpar" or by decoding),
   some lines are terminated by LF instead of CR+LF. This could lead to
   problems with some Windows editors and other Windows programs.
 - Bug fix: The wildcard ** did not work correctly. The recursion depth was
   always 1 level higher than specified. So level 0 was never possible.
   See https://szs.wiimm.de/doc/wildcards#2stars for details.
 - wszst ANALYZE: Added support of LE-CODE binaries.
 - wszst ANALYZE: A track can be valid, even if vrcorn_model.brres is missed.
 - wszst ANALYZE: Support of edit-slot ('e12' or 'ea12').
 - wszst SPLIT: Added support for "(author1,author2,,editor1,editor2)",
   LE-CODE flags + group, order by attribute, and for track category.
 - New file type: MTCAT: Import and export 'MKW Track Category' files.

~ - MDL support: Scanning a MDL file and transferring the data into an internal
~   format was already implemented, but only used for analysis purposes. Now it
~   is possible to create a binary MDL by reading the internal data. This is
~   the first step to add MDL materials to enable a track for slot 4.2.
~ - The tools verify the maximum number of CKPT, ENPT and ITPT (=255).

Known bugs:

 - Minimaps with an additional bones layer above 'posLD' and 'posRU' (e.g. for
   scaling) are handled incorrect on auto adjusting the minimap.
 - The tools try always to find the optimal PNG format by analyzing the main
   image. The bug is, that mipmaps (or following images in TPL) may need a
   different output format (for example colors instead of grayscale).
   SOLUTION: Force an output format with for example --transform RGBA32.
~ - Creating a BRRES from local files is buggy, because missing adjust of
~   several BRRES and string pool pointers.
~ - If creating a BRRES the internal name of the sub file is not set to
~   the filename. This could be problematic if a sub file was renamed.
