 - The tools support a configuration file now to define different paths.
   Therefor the file "wiimms-szs-tools.conf" is searched in different
   directories.
    - Option --config=file allows to define a specific config file.
    - Command CONFIG (available for all tools) prints an information about
      searching and the final settings.
    - wszst CONFIG can export configuration settings for scripts.
    - wszst CONFIG can create new or updated configuration files.
 - wszst ANALYZE:
    - Behavior changed for item position bug.
    - New warning if minimap is missed.
    - Detect AIParam.
    - Print Item Posisiton Factors.
 - Speedometer settings changed. It is either disabled or enabled with or
   without fraction (up to 3 digits).
 - wlect option --speedometer=modus accpets now parameters OFF, AUTO, ON,
   FRACTION (=1DIGIT), 2DIGITS and 3DIGITS.
 - LE-CODE supports debug output while racing. LPAR parameter DEBUG, LPAR
   sections [DEBUG-*] and wlect option --debug define the output format.
   See http://wiki.tockdom.com/wiki/LPAR#debug for details.
 - Wiimm's Item Cheat has been integrated into LE-CODE. It is enabled by a
   LPAR setting and supports Wiimote+Nunchuk, Classic Controller and GCN
   Controller for all 4 regions.
 - Bug fix for CT-CODE/LE-CODE configuration file: In v2.21a command 'S' was
   modified to accept 16 bit slot numbers. And here a copy bug is fixed now.

~ - MDL support: Scanning a MDL file and transferring the data into an internal
~   format was already implemented, but only used for analysis purposes. Now it
~   is possible to create a binary MDL by reading the internal data. This is
~   the first step to add MDL materials to enable a track for slot 4.2.
~ - The tools verify the maximum number of CKPT, ENPT and ITPT (=255).

Known bugs:

 - Minimaps with an additional bones layer above 'posLD' and 'posRU' (e.g. for
   scaling) are handled incorrect on auto adjusting the minimap.
 - The tools try always to find the optimal PNG format by analyzing the main
   image. The bug is, that mipmaps (or following images in TPL) may need a
   different output format (for example colors instead of grayscale).
   SOLUTION: Force an output format with for example --transform RGBA32.
~ - Creating a BRRES from local files is buggy, because missing adjust of
~   several BRRES and string pool pointers.
~ - If creating a BRRES the internal name of the sub file is not set to
~   the filename. This could be problematic if a sub file was renamed.
