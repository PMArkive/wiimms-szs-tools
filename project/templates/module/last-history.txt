 - Wildcard parsing has been reworked. In particular, the pipe character is
   now used as a special control character. In addition, the combined use with
   sub-files has been implemented for some commands. See built-in help and
   https://szs.wiimm.de/doc/wildcards for details.
 - New global option --no-wildcards: Disable wildcard parsing and use each
   filename exactly as specified.
 - The 114 commands of the following list including their short cuts accept
   wildcards as source now:

 - Tool wszst: New option --9laps patches files Race*.szs to enable lap 9.
   It is based on https://wiki.tockdom.com/wiki/Lap_Texture_Fix by Wingcapman.
 - For LE-CODE developers only:
    - LPAR:DEVELOPER-MODES can allow or forbid different developer modes.
    - LPAR:DEV-MODE1 .. LPAR:DEV-MODE3: Define some global developer modes.
    - New LEX section DEV1: Define some track dependent developer modes.

~ - KMP:STGI support for up to 255 laps.
~    - Option --kmp=MODES supports now settings 1LAP .. 15LAPS.
~    - New option --n-laps=LAPS override --kmp=MODES and accept 1 to 255 laps.
~
~ - MDL support: Scanning a MDL file and transferring the data into an internal
~   format was already implemented, but only used for analysis purposes. Now it
~   is possible to create a binary MDL by reading the internal data. This is
~   the first step to add MDL materials to enable a track for slot 4.2.
~ - The tools verify the maximum number of CKPT, ENPT and ITPT (=255).

Known bugs:

 - Minimaps with an additional bones layer above 'posLD' and 'posRU' (e.g. for
   scaling) are handled incorrect on auto adjusting the minimap.
 - The tools try always to find the optimal PNG format by analyzing the main
   image. The bug is, that mipmaps (or following images in TPL) may need a
   different output format (for example colors instead of grayscale).
   SOLUTION: Force an output format with for example --transform RGBA32.
~ - Creating a BRRES from local files is buggy, because missing adjust of
~   several BRRES and string pool pointers.
~ - If creating a BRRES the internal name of the sub file is not set to
~   the filename. This could be problematic if a sub file was renamed.
