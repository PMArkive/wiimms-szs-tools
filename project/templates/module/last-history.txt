 - wstrt PORT & wstrt WHERE:
    - Address scanning: If an address starts with letter 'm' or 'M' (main.dol)
      or 's' or 'S' (staticr.rel), then it is interpreted as file offset.
      If an address without prefix is exact 6 characters long, then value
      0x80000000 is added. This makes cut+paste from cheat codes easier.
    - New option: --no-0x (short: -0): Suppress 0x prefix for hex numbers.
    - New option: --long (short: -l): Print file offsets too.
 - wstrt PORT:
    - Bug fix: Wrong column was highlighted when region order was changed by
      option --order.
    - Internal porting database updated.
    - New option: --port-db=file: Load the specified update file and replace
      the internal porting database.
 - wstrt DUMP: More details for StaticR.rel files.
 - New command: wszst INSTALL: Install files to the shared directory.

~ - MDL support: Scanning a MDL file and transferring the data into an internal
~   format was already implemented, but only used for analysis purposes. Now it
~   is possible to create a binary MDL by reading the internal data. This is
~   the first step to add MDL materials to enable a track for slot 4.2.
~ - The tools verify the maximum number of CKPT, ENPT and ITPT (=255).

Known bugs:

 - Minimaps with an additional bones layer above 'posLD' and 'posRU' (e.g. for
   scaling) are handled incorrect on auto adjusting the minimap.
 - The tools try always to find the optimal PNG format by analyzing the main
   image. The bug is, that mipmaps (or following images in TPL) may need a
   different output format (for example colors instead of grayscale).
   SOLUTION: Force an output format with for example --transform RGBA32.
~ - Creating a BRRES from local files is buggy, because missing adjust of
~   several BRRES and string pool pointers.
~ - If creating a BRRES the internal name of the sub file is not set to
~   the filename. This could be problematic if a sub file was renamed.
