szs v@@VERSION@@ r@@REV-NEXT@@ - @@@@-@@-@@

 - Windows only: Updated 64 bit version of Cygwin to DLL 3.4.3 / 2022-12-16.
 - GNU Compiler (GNUC) upto version 13 supported.
 - wstrt PORT: Updated porting database.
 - Updated prefix database:
    - Added LBPK, M&SOWG, MP5, MP6, MSS, S1, S2, S3 and WFUS.
    - Renamed RV to Re-Volt
 - wszst PATCH --ignore: Keep silent if a wildcard pattern matches no file.
 - New command: wszst WILDCARDS: Each parameter is treated as a file name and
   wildcards are expanded. Finally, one line is printed for each matched name.
 - Tool wszst: New otpion --log-cache=file: Log some cache activities to FILE.
 - Improved detection of invalid references in KCL octree (avoid crash).

~ - MDL support: Scanning a MDL file and transferring the data into an internal
~   format was already implemented, but only used for analysis purposes. Now it
~   is possible to create a binary MDL by reading the internal data. This is
~   the first step to add MDL materials to enable a track for slot 4.2.
~ - The tools verify the maximum number of CKPT, ENPT and ITPT (=255).

Known bugs:

 - Minimaps with an additional bones layer above 'posLD' and 'posRU' (e.g. for
   scaling) are handled incorrect on auto adjusting the minimap.
 - The tools try always to find the optimal PNG format by analyzing the main
   image. The bug is, that mipmaps (or following images in TPL) may need a
   different output format (for example colors instead of grayscale).
   SOLUTION: Force an output format with for example --transform RGBA32.
~ - Creating a BRRES from local files is buggy, because missing adjust of
~   several BRRES and string pool pointers.
~ - If creating a BRRES the internal name of the sub file is not set to
~   the filename. This could be problematic if a sub file was renamed.
