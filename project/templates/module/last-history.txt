 - There is a new LEX section called "FEAT". It declares the special features
   of a track file. CTGP-R uses this declaration to manage ghost.
    - Command "wszst FEATURES" prints the feature list to standard output.
    - Command "wlect CREATE FEAT" creates a LEX template with section FEAT.
    - Patching option --lex-features adds or updates LEX section FEAT if any
      relevant feature is set.
    - Patching option --lex-rm-features removes LEX section FEAT.
 - Continuing the implementation of wlect DISTRIBUTION:
    - Fixed a use after free bug (Cygwin only, fixed with r8614).
    - Export of prefix list supports color_index now.
    - Improved filename normalisation (Cygwin only).
    - The file formats LE-REF and LE-DIS changed. They are *NOT* compatible
      to v2.28a.beta.
    - Support of lap count and speed factor for file formats LE-DEF and LE-REF.
    - New instruction: SEPARATOR=string. Define a separator that is used by
      other instructions (e.g. COPY=).
    - New instruction: SPLIT=DEST,SRC,FORMAT.

 - New option: wszst SPLIT --printf=format: Use the split filename to create
   a formatted string. See https://szs.wiimm.de/opt/printf for details.

~ - MDL support: Scanning a MDL file and transferring the data into an internal
~   format was already implemented, but only used for analysis purposes. Now it
~   is possible to create a binary MDL by reading the internal data. This is
~   the first step to add MDL materials to enable a track for slot 4.2.
~ - The tools verify the maximum number of CKPT, ENPT and ITPT (=255).

Known bugs:

 - Minimaps with an additional bones layer above 'posLD' and 'posRU' (e.g. for
   scaling) are handled incorrect on auto adjusting the minimap.
 - The tools try always to find the optimal PNG format by analyzing the main
   image. The bug is, that mipmaps (or following images in TPL) may need a
   different output format (for example colors instead of grayscale).
   SOLUTION: Force an output format with for example --transform RGBA32.
~ - Creating a BRRES from local files is buggy, because missing adjust of
~   several BRRES and string pool pointers.
~ - If creating a BRRES the internal name of the sub file is not set to
~   the filename. This could be problematic if a sub file was renamed.
