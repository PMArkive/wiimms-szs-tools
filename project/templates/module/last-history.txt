 - Windows only: Updated 64 bit version of Cygwin to DLL 3.4.9 / 2023-09-06.
 - Bug fix for wszst COPY: All format conversion options are now evaluated.
 - Fixed a bug that caused distribution files to be read incorrectly.
 - New compression formats:
    LZ:   Read and create LZ compressed files. LZ is like YAZ0 and BZ, but
          with LZMA compression.
    LZMA: Read and create LZMA compressed files. Tracks compressed with LZMA
          are approx 40% smaller than the YAZ0 compressed tracks.
    XZ:   Detect XZ compressed files.
 - Formats BZIP2, LZMA and XZ are compatible with external tools like 'bzip2',
   'lzma' and 'xz'.
 - Files compressed with BZ, BZIP2, LZ or LZMA are transparently decompressed.
   This means that they can be processed by all commands.
 - New options --lz, --lzma and --wlz to force compression with new formats.
 - LTA: Optionally, the compression method for the track files can be forced.
   Methods YAZ0, BZ, BZIP2, LZ and LZMA are available.
 - LTA: Maximum number of supported slots increased from 1024 to 4096.
 - wszst --cache=dir: Cache supports YAZ0, BZIP2 and LZMA compressed files now.
 - wlect DISTRIB --cache=dir: Use the cache if creating an LTA file when new
   compression is forced.
 - wszst XCOMMON: File "avail.txt" is no longer created.
 - Removed LPAR setting USE-AVAIL-TXT.

~ - KMP:STGI support for up to 255 laps.
~    - Option --kmp=MODES supports now settings 1LAP .. 15LAPS.
~    - New option --n-laps=LAPS override --kmp=MODES and accept 1 to 255 laps.
~
~ - MDL support: Scanning a MDL file and transferring the data into an internal
~   format was already implemented, but only used for analysis purposes. Now it
~   is possible to create a binary MDL by reading the internal data. This is
~   the first step to add MDL materials to enable a track for slot 4.2.
~ - The tools verify the maximum number of CKPT, ENPT and ITPT (=255).

Known bugs:

 - Minimaps with an additional bones layer above 'posLD' and 'posRU' (e.g. for
   scaling) are handled incorrect on auto adjusting the minimap.
 - The tools try always to find the optimal PNG format by analyzing the main
   image. The bug is, that mipmaps (or following images in TPL) may need a
   different output format (for example colors instead of grayscale).
   SOLUTION: Force an output format with for example --transform RGBA32.
~ - Creating a BRRES from local files is buggy, because missing adjust of
~   several BRRES and string pool pointers.
~ - If creating a BRRES the internal name of the sub file is not set to
~   the filename. This could be problematic if a sub file was renamed.
