 - Updated prefix database: Added MK8DX (alias of SW), MK8S, SBSPBfBB, SMB,
   SMBM, TFR, ZeldaWW (alias of WW).
 - Support for online-time-limit by LPAR and LEX:SET1.
 - Support for new LEX section RITP (Random next-links @KMP:ITPH).
 - Fixed end-of-line bugs in LEX text output (CR+LF required for Windows).
 - wlect dump: Colored flags.

~ - MDL support: Scanning a MDL file and transferring the data into an internal
~   format was already implemented, but only used for analysis purposes. Now it
~   is possible to create a binary MDL by reading the internal data. This is
~   the first step to add MDL materials to enable a track for slot 4.2.
~ - The tools verify the maximum number of CKPT, ENPT and ITPT (=255).

Known bugs:

 - Minimaps with an additional bones layer above 'posLD' and 'posRU' (e.g. for
   scaling) are handled incorrect on auto adjusting the minimap.
 - The tools try always to find the optimal PNG format by analyzing the main
   image. The bug is, that mipmaps (or following images in TPL) may need a
   different output format (for example colors instead of grayscale).
   SOLUTION: Force an output format with for example --transform RGBA32.
~ - Creating a BRRES from local files is buggy, because missing adjust of
~   several BRRES and string pool pointers.
~ - If creating a BRRES the internal name of the sub file is not set to
~   the filename. This could be problematic if a sub file was renamed.
