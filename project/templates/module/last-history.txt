 - wszst SPLIT: New output record: distrib_flags="number flags".
 - wlect DISTRIB:
    - Instructions cup-icons= and cup-info=:
       - By default, 5 characters are used for the name part. The source can
         now be specified as an optional storage indicator.
       - Fixed some issues.
    - Instruction distrib=: Improved track list.
    - New instruction report=: Analyse the distribution and print a report.
 - Tool wimgt: Improved generic images.
 - Fixed some pager and color issues.

~ - MDL support: Scanning a MDL file and transferring the data into an internal
~   format was already implemented, but only used for analysis purposes. Now it
~   is possible to create a binary MDL by reading the internal data. This is
~   the first step to add MDL materials to enable a track for slot 4.2.
~ - The tools verify the maximum number of CKPT, ENPT and ITPT (=255).

Known bugs:

 - Minimaps with an additional bones layer above 'posLD' and 'posRU' (e.g. for
   scaling) are handled incorrect on auto adjusting the minimap.
 - The tools try always to find the optimal PNG format by analyzing the main
   image. The bug is, that mipmaps (or following images in TPL) may need a
   different output format (for example colors instead of grayscale).
   SOLUTION: Force an output format with for example --transform RGBA32.
~ - Creating a BRRES from local files is buggy, because missing adjust of
~   several BRRES and string pool pointers.
~ - If creating a BRRES the internal name of the sub file is not set to
~   the filename. This could be problematic if a sub file was renamed.
