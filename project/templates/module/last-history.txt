 - Continuing the implementation of LEX/FEAT:
    - Comamnd wszst FEATURES: Options for value 3 (impact) are printed always.
    - Option --print-modes removed.
    - Option --long (-l and -ll) used to append human readable flags.
 - Updated internal prefix database.
 - Tool wstrt: Option --add-section=PATH supports now wildcards. In this case
   PATH is used as search pattern and all found files are added. In order to
   use this variant, the calling shell must not interpret the wildcards.
   Therefore, PATH must usually be enclosed in single or double quotes.
 - Bug fix: Option --all-ranks accepts keyword RESTORE now. Due to a spelling
   mistake, only RETORE was recognized so far.
 
~ - MDL support: Scanning a MDL file and transferring the data into an internal
~   format was already implemented, but only used for analysis purposes. Now it
~   is possible to create a binary MDL by reading the internal data. This is
~   the first step to add MDL materials to enable a track for slot 4.2.
~ - The tools verify the maximum number of CKPT, ENPT and ITPT (=255).

Known bugs:

 - Minimaps with an additional bones layer above 'posLD' and 'posRU' (e.g. for
   scaling) are handled incorrect on auto adjusting the minimap.
 - The tools try always to find the optimal PNG format by analyzing the main
   image. The bug is, that mipmaps (or following images in TPL) may need a
   different output format (for example colors instead of grayscale).
   SOLUTION: Force an output format with for example --transform RGBA32.
~ - Creating a BRRES from local files is buggy, because missing adjust of
~   several BRRES and string pool pointers.
~ - If creating a BRRES the internal name of the sub file is not set to
~   the filename. This could be problematic if a sub file was renamed.
